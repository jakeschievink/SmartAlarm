#Smart Alarm
![alt tag](https://raw.github.com/jakeschievink/SmartAlarm/master/screenshot.png)
An alarm program I made in the winter of 2013.
The alarm program grabs flashcard sets from quizlet.com and then reads the aloud to the user when the alarm goes off.
It functions, but there are many improvements which I would like to see. (See issues)
